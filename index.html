            <p id="bio">Hello, my name is Stefan Kashner. I currently reside where I was born and raised, in Aston,
                Pennsylvania. I grew up as a die hard sports fan and tech junkie that spent most of my time running
                around a field or playing games infront of a monitor. As I grew older, I slowly transitioned from
                watching and/or participating in mainstream sports to training in mixed-martial arts, specifically
                Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This art became the most addicting hobby I've ever experienced, infact I wouldn't
                even call it a hobby, it's more of a lifestyle. I have been training now for seven years and teaching
                for two years. While I may have made a change in my sports preferences, my tech habits have not changed
                as much. I still spend quite a bit of time infront of that monitor, but now instead of playing games
                and having fun, I'm working to build a new career in web development. I've always had a passion to work
                with computers, but never took the necessary steps to make it happen, until now. I recently left my
                career as an HVAC technician to focus on learning web development at Penn University in Philadelphia.
